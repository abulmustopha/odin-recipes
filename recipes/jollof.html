        <h1> JOLLOF RICE RECIPE </h1>
        <img src="../images/jollof.jpg" alt="Jollof rice recipe picture" height="250" width="250">
        
        <p>Jollof is a staple across West Africa, and every country has their own variation. 
            There’s a mostly friendly rivalry called “jollof wars,” over which country has the 
            best jollof rice, but I think jollof is always good, no matter where it comes from. </p>
        
        <p> Rice is cooked in a mixture of blended tomatoes, peppers,
        onions, and garlic, as well as stock and plenty of herbs and seasonings,
        and all of the delicious flavors infuse into the rice as it cooks.
        Traditionally it was cooked over an open flame, which gave it 
        its signature smoky flavor, but you can still achieve that rich 
        smokiness on the stovetop.</p>
