            <p> Amala is a traditional Nigerian cuisine that is popular in the southwestern
                part of Nigeria, particularly among the Yoruba tribe.
                It is a type of swallow made from yam flour and is usually served with a soup 
                stew, such as Ewedu, gbegiri, Okro soup, Egusi Soup, efo riro, and Ogbono Soup,
                obe ata.
                In Nigeria, Amala is not just food; it is a cultural identity. 
                It is a symbol of the Yoruba tribe and is often served at important events such as 
                weddings and funerals. It is an all-time favorite and a constant on the menu of most 
                local restaurants, and it is also a common meal for families to enjoy together.
